# Advent of Code 2022

## Overview

In 2022 I decided to participate in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I tried to create
a working solution for all 24 exercises however some of them might not represent the optimal or most
efficient way. Additionally, I didn't use a single programming language to solve all puzzles. Most
code is written in Rust, C# or Python. C# and Python are the languages I know best and Rust since I
was learning it during that time.
